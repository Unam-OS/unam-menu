# unam-menu
Lightweight and simple app launcher for Unam OS

**Info:** you may have issues on app launching. Still working on it...

# How to use
- Copy the Python script to /usr/bin and add execution privileges
- Make the python script be run on startup
- **To show the menu, press Super+Q**

*Also note that you can launch the menu in drawer mode (like Chrome OS) by launching the process with the '-d' flag*

Now, the menu should pop up whenever you press the hotkey (hotkey customization coming soon)
